# clickyGame

## Description

For this assignment, you'll create a memory game with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.



### Instructions

1. The page will render different images for the user to view on the screen.

2. The application will keep track of the user's score and will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. If a user's score is reset to 0 if they click on the same image more than once.

3. Everytime an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. If the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess the game will restart. 

## Installation
